1. we are using webpack as a bundler because we configure it through create-react-app

2. 
- npm install create-react-app
- npx create-react-app <app-name>

3. we have configured tailwind for create-react-app refering(https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)


4. after making some basic components with normal div lets setup the routing by installing `react-router-dom` -> `npm i -D react-router-dom`


5. so this way we will create the routes then
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <Login/>
    },
    {
        path: "/Browse",
        element: <Browse/>
    }
])

createBrowserRouter is from react-router-dom


6. then in return statement of body, instead of passing direct components we have to return RouteProvider like `<RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>`


7. Read about positioning in html, we have used absolute for header's logo image which will basically overlap with the image of login page


8. we gave gradient to the netflix logo


9. in login.js file we have made a issigninform state variable bec we want to know the state of form i.e. is it a sign in form or a sign up form

10. see how we made toggle feature on login file

11. see how we have added new input box based on toggle feature in login.js
{!isSignInForm && <input 
    type="Mobile Number" 
    placeholder="Mobile Number" 
    className="p-3 m-3 w-full bg-[#171716] rounded-lg border-[1px] border-slate-50"
/>}
